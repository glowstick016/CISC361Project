# CISC361Project
Final project for cisc361
This was a project for the class "Operating Systems". With the task to make a round robin system that could deal with tasks given to an operating system. 
My solution to this was a C++ project that was compormised of a triple layered system that broke down each task for what it was and then handled processing time with a different incriment based on the commands givne to it.
